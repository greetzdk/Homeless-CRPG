This document explains how locations function.

Hubs contain links to SUBHUB locations. SUBHUBS are wrapped in a span class, which is replaced with CONTENT from LINK when the player chooses an option (Moving to a different room or taking an action).
Rooms aren't actually a conventional room, but instead contains a DESCRIPTION and a set of ACTIONS. 
ACTIONS then leads to more ACTIONS or goes back to a ROOM (Clicking GO BACK leads back to the Sub Hub, as it is the last passage the player *actually* entered.
