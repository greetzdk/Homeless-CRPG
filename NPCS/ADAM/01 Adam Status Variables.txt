This is the mood/staus for each numbered variable. They do not scale, but need to be set to specific.

$adamIntent is the number.
$adamStatus is body language.
$adamMood is what the player discerns.

adamIntent becomes the number which must be loaded from the two arrays adamstatus/mood. It then displays the number variable as text.

0 = Indifferent.
