This is the page where stuff is setup. That's neat. Also, if you're playing this you're 18+ of age, otherwise you can't. No, I mean you literally can't. It's physically impossible.

Your character was recently made homeless due to certain events, how is up to you, but their age is set in stone. It may change during the game as events pass - that's right! - a game where you don't have to relentlessly stalk characters to learn their schedule!

This game will adapt to your (my) taste as you play. Going voluntary will lead to more classic porn, while going involuntary will lead to darker places. 

Oh, right! I'm in a bad place these days, struggling to cope with repressed memories of childhood abuse and how much shit has gotten thrown my way, so this game includes rape. So much rape. Jesus, it's almost like somebody is trying to explore their trauma by roleplaying, or is it just me? Haha. Dear god... Just... Let's start the game.
