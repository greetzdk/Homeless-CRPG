<h1>A Touching Story</h1><br>
I don't remember it. Whenever I think back there's these holes and gaps, like there's chinks of time missing. I think it was pretty okay.

	<div class="choiceCharisma">
<<radiobutton "$originStoryChildhood" "originViolent">>
<h1>They're Just Arguing</h1><br>
I had a decent enough childhood. Except for the yelling. And the fighting. Okay, in between my dad beating me and my mom yelling all the time, I'd say I had a decent childhood.

<h1>12 Steps Away</h1><br>
Most of my childhood was spent in nature. I liked being at home well enough when my dad was sober. Which was rarely.

<h1>The Punk</h1><br>
Nevermind the bollocks, I turned punk. Skipping school and looking awesome in my leather jacket, as I'd chainsmoke behind the local grocery store.

<h1>Runaway Issue #1</h1><br>
One evening I decided to run away from home. Eventually the police found me and brought me back home, but not before my parents manage to sell of most my stuff.

I crunched the numbers and realized it's all ones and zeroes. Who needs people when you can flee into videogames and masturbate to porn all day.

I have no idea why I'm still living at home, but this is it. Having had enough, I've chosen to confront my parents about their awful behaviour.

	<div class="choiceCharisma">

<h1>Transgender Blues</h1><br>
I'm living alone, attending university, and living my life. Part of that is undergoing medicinal therapy for when I get my transitioning surgery.

No more, I'm done with this abusive relationship. I thought they loved me, but I can't fool myself anymore. Unfortunatly.
