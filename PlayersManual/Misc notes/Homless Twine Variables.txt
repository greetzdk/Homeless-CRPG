Started Working on Skin Color... Why? It's really not necessary. "His sperm splatters erotically on your IVORY WHITE skin. And falls on your GARGANTUAN PALE boobs." Useless, really.

Print Minus and plus.
 
       I'm an Idiot and wanted a stat page that updated in real time... oh, wow, haha. I'm an idiot. No wonder I havent seen a single game that doesn't refer back to it self to update numbers. But goddamn it! I want my game!
       
       Hide plus if available points are equal to zero.
       Show plus if spendable points equal to one or greater than zero.
    
       Hide minus if available points equal to 6.
       Show minus if available points are less than 6.
    
       You need to set plus and minus as prints with variables inside of them.
    
       I'm a fucking idiot. Set an if and elseif statement INSIDE the link.

    Super simple. If a player doesn't have points, it doesn't do anything. Idiot awar goes to me. And     then not to me for fixing it. It's a very complicate award system.
