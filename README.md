INTRODUCTION
Hey! I see you've gotten a hold of my super secret project. That's cool. Super cool.

Basically this is where I write the code. I much prefer the functionality of an actual editor to - whatever the heck - Twine has built in. So I copy paste code from here to the different blocks in Twine. I'm also taking this as an opportunity to make my game (hopefully) easily readable for anyone interested in modding or making their own game.

FOR BEGINNER GAME MAKERS
For those new to making games, yes, you can copy paste entire chunks of code without repercussions. That's actually how most coding gets done. Just remember to change the variables and make sure you understand how the code works. Otherwise it's just going to mess up your entire system.

Luckily, for that exact purpose, each folder has a 01 file inside of it, explaining what each block does and how it functions.

Things that ARE NOT EXPLAINED: CSS, HTML, and Basic Twine functions. Just google anything you don't quite get. I started this project with zero knowledge of any sort of coding - If a looser like me can do it, so can you! I believe in you.
